/**
 * The side panel: table settings docked beside the table instead of
 * floating over it.
 *
 * A popover is right for a control you touch once and dismiss. It is wrong
 * for the work of setting a table up — choosing columns, building a filter,
 * arranging a pivot — because that is iterative: change one thing, look at
 * the rows, change another. A popover closes when you look away, and the
 * rows are behind it while it is open. A docked panel stays put and shares
 * the width, which is why every serious grid grows one.
 *
 * What core owns here is the part a kit would get subtly wrong: the tabs
 * are a real `tablist` with roving focus, arrow keys wrap and move the
 * selection with them, Escape closes from anywhere inside, and the panel
 * body is a `tabpanel` labelled by its tab. Which panel is showing is
 * state, and state belongs here rather than in seven copies. Putting focus
 * back after a close belongs to whatever opened the panel, which is the
 * only thing that knows where focus was.
 *
 * What the kit owns is everything visible: the panel's frame, the tab
 * buttons, the close control. There is no fallback for those — a docked
 * panel drawn in raw HTML inside an MUI table is exactly the mismatch the
 * slots law exists to prevent.
 *
 * The panels themselves are content the caller supplies. That is what lets
 * the same chrome hold a filter form, a column list, or a pivot builder
 * without knowing what any of them are.
