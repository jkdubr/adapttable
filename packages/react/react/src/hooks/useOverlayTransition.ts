/**
 * Turn an `open` boolean into something an overlay can animate on both edges.
 *
 * `rendered` outlives `open` by one exit, and `state` reports where in the
 * transition the overlay is. Two details make it work:
 *
 * - **Arriving needs a painted start value.** Mounting straight into the open
 *   state gives the browser nothing to transition from, so `state` holds
 *   `"closed"` for the frame after mount and flips on the next one.
 * - **Reduced motion skips both edges.** No frame delay arriving, no lingering
 *   node leaving. Nothing travels, and nothing is left in the tree waiting for
 *   a transition that will not run.
 *
 * The caller owns accessibility during the exit: while `state` is `"closed"`
 * the overlay is still in the DOM, so it must be made inert and hidden from
 * assistive technology, and focus must go back to the trigger immediately
 * rather than when the animation ends.
 *
 * @param open - Whether the overlay should be showing.
 * @param exitMs - How long the exit takes. Defaults to
 * {@link OVERLAY_MOTION.exitMs}; pass the real duration if the caller animates
 * for longer, or the node is removed mid-slide.
 * @returns Whether to render, and which end of the transition to render at.
