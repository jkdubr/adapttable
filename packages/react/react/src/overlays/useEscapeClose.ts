/**
 * Close an overlay on Escape, from wherever focus happens to be.
 *
 * Kits disagree about this. Most close on their own. Mantine's `Popover`
 * reacts only once focus is inside the dropdown, so a menu left with focus
 * on its trigger never closes. MUI's Modal is the same after a cancelled
 * rename: focus is back on the action, and the next Escape is swallowed.
 * Mantine and Chakra also close too eagerly, dismissing the whole menu when
 * the column rename editor was the one answering. Those kits hand the key
 * to this hook instead, so one rule covers every kit.
 *
 * **One key, one layer.** The listener runs in the capture phase, ahead of
 * every library handler, which is the only way to be reliable across kits.
 * That also means an inner control cannot stop it by the usual route — a
 * bubble-phase `stopPropagation` happens far too late — so controls that own
 * Escape are named explicitly by `ignoreWithin`. Cancelling a column rename
 * closes the editor; the Escape after it closes the menu.
