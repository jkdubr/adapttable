/**
 * Validation that gates a commit — and gates nothing else.
 *
 * The host owns persistence. A validator's only power is to stop `onCellEdit`
 * from firing and to put a message on the cell; it never rejects a draft the
 * reader is still typing, never rewrites a value, and never decides what to
 * save. That boundary is what keeps validation composable with a host that
 * validates again on the server, which it will.
 *
 * Two levels, because they answer different questions. A **cell** validator
 * knows one value: is this a number, is it in range, is the SKU real. A **row**
 * validator sees the row the edit would produce and can answer the questions no
 * single cell can — an end date before its start, a total that must match its
 * parts. A cell failure marks that cell; a row failure marks the row and may
 * name cells too.
 *
 * Both may be async, because the interesting checks are: "is this username
 * taken" is a request. An async check leaves the editor open and the cell marked
 * busy rather than blocking the keystroke, and a newer draft supersedes an older
 * check — a stale answer must never mark a value the reader has already changed.
