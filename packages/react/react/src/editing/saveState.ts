/**
 * What a cell shows while its edit is being saved, and what happens when the
 * save fails.
 *
 * `onCellEdit` may return a promise. If it does, the table knows something the
 * reader cannot see: the value is on its way somewhere. A cell that looks
 * committed while a request is still out is a lie the reader finds out about
 * only when it fails — so the cell is marked saving until the promise settles,
 * and marked failed with the reason if it rejects.
 *
 * The table still does not own the data. An optimistic table has already shown
 * the new value (the host applied it in `onCellEdit`), so a rejection has to put
 * the old one back: `onRollback` hands the host the previous value to restore,
 * because only the host can write to its own rows.
