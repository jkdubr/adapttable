/**
 * Undo and redo, without the table ever owning the data.
 *
 * The boundary is the whole design: AdaptTable never mutates rows, so it
 * cannot "restore" anything. What it can do is remember the value a cell held
 * before an edit and, on undo, COMMIT that value back through `onCellEdit` —
 * the same call the original edit made. Everything the host wrapped around
 * editing (validation, a mutation, an optimistic update, a toast) runs on the
 * way back exactly as it ran on the way out.
 *
 * A gesture is one entry, not one cell. Pasting two hundred cells and pressing
 * undo once puts all two hundred back, because that is what a person means by
 * "undo that paste" — and it is why the batch routes come through here rather
 * than each cell recording itself.
