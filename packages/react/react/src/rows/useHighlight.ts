/**
 * "Flash the row I just created."
 *
 * After a save, an import or a paste, the thing that changed is somewhere in
 * a list of a thousand rows and the user has no way to find it. A brief
 * highlight answers that — and it is the kind of feature that gets built as
 * a `setTimeout` in the host, three times, slightly differently.
 *
 * Two things make it worth owning here.
 *
 * The first is that reduced motion does not mean no feedback. A user who
 * asked for less motion still needs to know which row changed; what they
 * asked to be spared is the movement. So the highlight still appears and
 * still clears — it holds steady instead of fading, and holds longer to make
 * up for the missing transition. Dropping it entirely would read the
 * preference as "tell me less", which it is not.
 *
 * The second is that a highlight has to survive the row moving. Sorting,
 * filtering and paging all reorder rows, and a mark keyed to a position
 * would light up whatever landed there. These are keyed by row id and cell
 * address, so the mark travels with the data.
