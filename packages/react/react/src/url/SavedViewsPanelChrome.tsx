/**
 * Managing saved views: the list, and what you can do to each one.
 *
 * The saved-views *menu* answers "switch to a view". This answers "keep the
 * list in order" — rename, reorder, delete, and choose the one the table
 * opens with. They are different jobs and putting both in a dropdown makes
 * the common one harder, so this is a panel rather than a deeper menu.
 *
 * The panel is a card with a title, and each view is one row inside it. The
 * row has a single primary action: **applying the view is clicking its name**,
 * which is the thing a reader wants nine times out of ten and the widest
 * target on the row. Everything else — rename, move, default, delete — is an
 * icon in a compact cluster at the end of the line, each with its own
 * localized accessible name.
 *
 * That shape is a decision the chrome owns rather than each kit. Six equally
 * weighted text buttons per row read as six equal choices, and a list of views
 * where "Delete view" is as loud as the view's own name is a list that is
 * harder to use the more it holds.
 *
 * Reordering is buttons, not drag, for the same reason the pivot panel's is:
 * a list you can only reorder by dragging is a list some people cannot
 * reorder. Renaming is an inline text input rather than a modal prompt — the
 * name is right there, and a dialog to change one word is a dialog too many.
 *
 * Structure, ordering, part names, labels, glyphs and the row's layout live
 * here. Every visible control is a required slot the adapter fills with its
 * own kit's component.
