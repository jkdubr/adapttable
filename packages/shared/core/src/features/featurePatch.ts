 * The feature patch layer — how a `features` array becomes table options.

 * defined host option wins over every feature. The result forgets
 * `features` and remembers which list produced it, and resolving an already
 * resolved object is a no-op — so a kit and the shell can both apply.
 *
 * The binding adds what it draws (providers, slot renders) on its own
 * feature type; the merge is the same for every binding, so it lives here.
