/**
 * What a context-menu Copy acts on, with cell navigation and without it.
 *
 * The menu hands a binding a {@link ContextMenuTarget} — a row key and a
 * column key, the identity of what was clicked. With cell navigation, copying
 * needs a grid address, and the two are not the same thing: a row's position
 * on screen follows the sort, the filter, the page, the pinned rows and the
 * virtual window, none of which a row key knows. The grid's `cellAt` resolves
 * it against the very rows and columns the grid was handed, so this decides
 * only WHICH cell is meant. Without cell navigation there is no grid address
 * and no range, but the target already names the row and the column, which is
 * all a single cell needs.
