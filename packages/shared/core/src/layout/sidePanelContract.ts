/**
 * The side panel's contract: the props its Chrome takes and the pieces a kit
 * fills it with.
 *
 * Every binding's side-panel Chrome owns the same `tablist` — roving focus,
 * wrapping arrows, Escape to close — and lets the kit draw the frame, the tab
 * buttons and the close control. Rendered content is the binding's `TNode`,
 * key events are its `TKeyboardEvent`, and a panel is the binding's own
 * `TPanel` entry (core knows a panel by its key; the binding adds its caption
 * and content), so a React kit and an Angular kit fill the same shapes with
 * their own types.
