# @adapttable/angular

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c9a865: New package: `@adapttable/angular`, the headless Angular binding (Angular 20 and newer). Core's stores become signals: `injectFrontendData` is the in-memory tier, `injectTableUrlState` the URL-synced view state, and `injectDataTable` the headless table with its attribute getters. `ColumnDef` renders cells, headers and footers with an `ng-template` or a standalone component, and `provideAdaptTableFeatures` composes features through dependency injection. It draws no controls; the markup is the host's.
